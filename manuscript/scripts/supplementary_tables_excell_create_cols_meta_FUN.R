#' @title Create .cols sidecar meta data file
#' @description This function creates a .cols sidecar meta data file of column name descriptions for a given table.
#' It checks if all column names in the table variable name are described in the colname_descriptions and stops with an error message if not.
#' The .cols file is saved in the same directory as the table variable name with the same name as the file name.
#' 
#' @param file_name A character string specifying the path and file name (including the .csv part) of the corresponding table meta data is created for.
#' @param table_variable_name A data frame for which metadata is being generated.
#' @param colname_descriptions A named character vector where names correspond to column names of `table_variable_name` and values are their descriptions.
#'
#' @return Writes a `.cols` metadata file as a side effect. No object is returned.
