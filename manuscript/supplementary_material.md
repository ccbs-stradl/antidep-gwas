# Methods

## mBAT-combo analysis

SNPs with effective sample sizes \< 0.8 or with duplicate IDs were
removed from the meta-analysed summary statistics. Default values for
mBAT-combo were used as follows: the minimum proportion of the total
variance in the LD matrix explained by the top principal components used
in the mBAT test was 0.9 (–mBAT-svd-gamma 0.9), a gene region was
defined as spanning 50 kb upstream and downstream of the gene’s
untranslated region (–mBAT-wind 50), SNPs with allele frequency
difference between GWAS summary and LD reference data \> 0.2 were
removed (–diff-freq 0.2) and the threshold for LD r-squared value for LD
pruning was 0.9 (–fastBAT-ld-cutoff 0.9).

zoom region plot shows association of SNPs with the antidepressant
phenotype N06A zoomed to the region 17:44752612:44952612 for each
ancestry (EUR, AFR and SAS). The output from SuSiEx shows the Posterior
Inclusion Probability (PIP). The horizontal red line on the credible set
plot represents the threshold at which a credible set is defined and
SNPs are considered potentially causal (PIP \> 0.8), these SNPs are
highlighted in the locus zoom plots.
