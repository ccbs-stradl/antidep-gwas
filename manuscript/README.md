# Documentation for figures, tables, data associated with the manuscript write up

Enables us to keep track of where figures and tables come from.

Maybe include an .Rmd which outputs text with key numeric values, eg. sample sizes. 

## Figures
eg. Figure X: ../fineMapping/plots/region_plot_3:16751665:16962555.png

## Tables

| Table Name | Legend | Location | Script |
| :------: | :------: | :----: | :----: |
| Supplementary Table XXXX | Significant positionally mapped genes using mBAT-combo (Bonferroni corrected P < 0.05), in the European sample. African and South Asian samples returned no positionally mapped genes. | `antidep-gwas/manuscript/tables/mBAT-combo.EUR.csv`  | `antidep-gwas/manuscript/scripts/tables_mBAT-combo.R`
